    "transcription": " Good afternoon dear members of the jury. This research explores how language used in social media influences teenagers' perceptions of human appearance. In today's digital environment, visual content is almost always accompanied by short expressive captions and comments. These messages frequently contain slang expressions that evaluate appearance and gradually shape ideas about attractiveness and bodily norms. The purpose of this study was not only to identify slang expressions related to appearance, but also to understand how they function and what influence they may have on self-perception. I focused on how such expressions describe physical traits, what meanings they carry and how repeated exposure to them may shape beauty standards among adolescents.",

        "feedback": "The presentation content is well-researched and highly relevant to contemporary sociological and linguistic studies. You have successfully established the connection between digital slang and psychological self-perception among adolescents. The language used is formal and perfectly suited for a project defense. Your vocal delivery is impressive; it conveys a strong sense of authority and professional calm. The voice sounds stable and purposeful, which helps in maintaining the audience's attention and establishing credibility right from the start. This level of vocal presence suggests that you are well-prepared and confident in your findings.",
        "tips": "To make the introduction even more engaging, consider starting with a specific, striking example of a slang term currently trending on social media. While your structure is logical, ensure that when you transition from the 'purpose' to the 'focus' of your study, you use vocal signposting—like a brief pause or a change in pitch—to help the jury follow your shift in topic. Additionally, practicing eye contact (even in a digital setting) alongside your confident vocal tone will further reinforce your professional image."
